## How It Works

### Smart Prompt Generation
The system creates intelligent image prompts based on:
1. **Content Hook**: The main topic/message of your post
2. **Platform**: Determines the visual style (professional, social, dynamic)
3. **Niche**: Your brand's industry/focus area
4. **Trend Context**: The trend you're posting about

**Example Prompt Generation**:
- For LinkedIn: "professional, corporate, minimalist, clean, business-appropriate image about AI in marketing"
- For Instagram: "vibrant, aesthetic, eye-catching, modern, social media friendly image about coffee trends"

### Using Pollinations.AI
- **Free Service**: No API key or payment required
- **High Quality**: Enhanced images with no watermarks
- **Fast Generation**: Typical response time of 2-5 seconds per image
- **No Rate Limits**: Generate as many images as you need

## Technical Details

### Image URLs
Generated images use the Pollinations.AI format:
```
https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/{encoded_prompt}?width={w}&height={h}&nologo=true&enhance=true
```

Parameters:
- `nologo=true`: Removes watermarks
- `enhance=true`: Improves image quality
- `width` & `height`: Platform-specific dimensions

### Database Storage
- `image_url`: TEXT field storing the full Pollinations.AI URL
- `image_prompt`: TEXT field storing the prompt used for generation
- Both fields are nullable (optional)

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's
- ‚úÖ Generate images for professional platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram)
- ‚úÖ Regenerate if the first image doesn't match your content
- ‚úÖ Use the image filter to track which content needs images
- ‚úÖ Include images in your CSV exports for scheduling tools

### ‚ùå Don'ts

- ‚ùå Don't use images that include unintended text or elements
- ‚ùå Don't skip reviewing images before publishing
